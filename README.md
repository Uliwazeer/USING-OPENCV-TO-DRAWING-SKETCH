Opencv library explanation:
Explanation of the opencv library: One of the goals of Python that its team seeks to achieve is to highlight the position of Python as a reliable and reliable programming language in libraries and programming frameworks. The OpenCV library is one of the most famous and powerful libraries in the field of image and video processing, and there are a variety of areas in which we can benefit from the OpenCV library , especially in the medical, industrial, artificial intelligence and machine learning fields.


OpenCV consists of several algorithms and code compiled into a single framework. The main objective of this framework is to provide solutions in computer vision .

I will not extend the explanation by mentioning the history of the library and what this library is characterized by or what it offers, but you, dear reader, can get a more comprehensive and broader idea through the Wikipedia website at this link

OpenCV and Python library
Recent versions of OpenCV now support Python. The OpenCV library was developed using C++ (the first version was built in C).

In terms of execution speed, C and C++ are faster than Python, so rebuilding the OpenCV library in Python would be unhelpful in the speedy image and video processing field.

OpenCV offers so-called Python Wrappers , which enables you to use the library inside Python code in the form of Python packages and functions.

These Wrappers are interfaces that call library functions built in C and C++, which means that the application is built in Python (the ease element and little code) and implemented in the native library language (the speed element).

OpenCV Library - Simple Example
Examples that can be given here are many, but one of the exercises that I enjoyed during my modest studies of OpenCV and Python is the example of Object Detection.

In the topic of Object Detection comes the example of testing the presence of faces in the image or video.

Where when you install the library, you will find a folder of exercises and tests containing many exercises, including this example.

But as I was preparing for this article, I thought to myself, Why the faces? Can't we apply the example so that the program tests for the presence of another object?
